<div class="panel-body">					(Adapted from Imbibe Magazine)<br /><br />In a large container, mix ground coffee with water. Cover and allow to sit at room temperature eight hours or overnight. <br /><br />Line a fine mesh strainer with cheesecloth and set over a pitcher or other container. Pour coffee/water mixture through the strainer, allowing all liquid to run through. Discard grounds. <br /><br />Place coffee liquid in the fridge and allow to cool. Use as needed. <br /><br />To make iced coffee, pack a glass full of ice cubes. Fill glass 2/3 full with coffee liquid. Add healthy splash of half-and-half. Add 2-3 tablespoons sweetened condensed milk (can use plain sugar instead) and stir to combine. Taste and adjust half-and-half and/or sweetened condensed milk as needed.				</div>
